            <h1>Filler Words</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">This artwork is inspired by the words that make me, me. I have always struggled with speaking to others without sounding awkward and I tend to use filler words like um and uh as a "shield," but it also contributes to my struggles. So, I depicted these filler words falling down on me as I look up in distress in my artwork.</p>
